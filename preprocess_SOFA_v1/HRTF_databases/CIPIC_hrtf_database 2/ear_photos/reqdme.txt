The images provided here were taken at the time the HRTF  was measured. They have been cropped  so as to avoid the identification of subjects. 
For some subjects, an image of the back of the head is also made available. All pinna images include a ruler or a short black strip, 5 cm long, that allows distances and sizes not included in the anthropometry data to be determined.

The directories kemar_frontal and kemar_horizontal contain uniformly
sampled HRIR data for the KEMAR mannequin in the frontal and horizontal
planes, respectively.

To obtain uniform angular increments in these two planes, these data sets
use a different data format than our standard data.  The coordinates and
special data formats are described in the read_me files for each data set.

The files large_pinna_frontal.mat and small_pinna_frontal.mat contain
HRIR data in the frontal plane for the KEMAR mannequin with large and
small pinnae, respectively.

In the frontal plane, it is convenient to use the vertical-polar coordinate
system, so that the elevation angle, measured from the horizontal, ranges
from -45 degrees to 230.6250 degrees with spacing of 2.8125 degrees.  The
right ear is ipsilateral for the lower elevations.

Each mat file contains 2 arrays (size 200 x 99) "left" and "right", which
correspond to the left and right pinna.

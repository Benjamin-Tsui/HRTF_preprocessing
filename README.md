# HRTF_preprocessing


This is a tool that could perform the required HRTF preparation process for machine learning in a fast and robust way. It could check common errors in SOFA files (e.g. missing data, abnormal measurement distribution), modifies SOFA files (e.g. remove abnormal data), finds common measurement angles within a range, finds the best normalise attributes (HRIR length, sampling frequency), normalises and save the modified measurements as new SOFA files.
